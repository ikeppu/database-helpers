# Introduction to ER Models

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model

Entities: Represent real-world objects or concepts, such as Student, Instructor, Course, Department, and Enrollment.

Attributes: Describe properties of entities, like Student ID, Name, and Date of Birth for the Student entity.

Relationships: Define connections between entities, such as a Student enrolling in a Course or an Instructor teaching a Course.

Rectangles: Represent entities or groups of entities, known as entity sets, such as Student or Course.

Ellipses: Represent attributes, which are properties of entities like Name or Student ID.

Diamonds: Depict relationships between entities, like a Student enrolling in a Course.

Lines: Show connections between entities and attributes or between entities and relationships.

Double Ellipses: Used to indicate derived attributes, which are calculated from other attributes, such as Age derived from Date of Birth.

Double Rectangle: Double Rectangle represents a Weak Entity.
